# React Native FlatList Empty Array Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component renders as empty when the API response is an empty array.  The provided solution demonstrates how to gracefully handle this scenario.

## Problem

When fetching data from an API and the response is an empty array, the FlatList component might not render anything, potentially confusing the user.  This bug shows that specific scenario and how to fix it.

## Solution

The solution includes a check to see if the data array is empty. If it is, a message indicating no data is displayed, thus improving the user experience.
